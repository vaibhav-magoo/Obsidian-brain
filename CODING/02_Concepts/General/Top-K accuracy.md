> [!NOTE]
> **Top-k accuracy is an **evaluation metric** used in machine learning, particularly for **multi-class classification** problems, to assess a model's performance.**

-  traditional accuracy metrics that consider a prediction correct only if the top predicted label matches the true label
- top-k accuracy allows the correct label to be within the top k predictions made by the model.
- useful in tasks like image classification, natural language processing, and recommendation systems, where there can be subtle differences between classes or multiple valid outputs
