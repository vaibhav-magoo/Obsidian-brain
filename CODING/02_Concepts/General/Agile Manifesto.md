WHAT? - Agile Manifesto is an alternative to traditional software development methodologies.

## **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**

	Your team is your most valuable resource. Communication plays a key role here —    when people interact with each other regularly and share their ideas, they build      better products.

##  **Working software over comprehensive documentation**

	teams would spend hours creating exhaustive documents with technical specifications
	The Agile philosophy is to streamline these documents and condense the information into user stories

## **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation**
	highlights the importance of customer collaboration
	 By delving into their specific needs while the software is still being built, developers can gain valuable insights to create the ultimate user experience.


## **Responding to change over following a plan**
	Traditional methodologies advocated for as little change as possible,
	Agile teams work in short, iterative cycles, meaning they can react quickly and implement changes on a continuous basis. This ultimately leads to better products.


# AGILE MANIFESTO PRINCIPLES

### **The 12 Principles of Agile Software**

1. **Customer Satisfaction:** Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
    
2. **Welcome Change:** Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
    
3. **Frequent Delivery:** Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
    
4. **Collaboration:** Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
    
5. **Motivated Individuals:** Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
    
6. **Face-to-Face Conversation:** The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
    
7. **Working Software:** Working software is the primary measure of progress.
    
8. **Sustainable Development:** Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
    
9. **Technical Excellence:** Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
    
10. **Simplicity:** Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
    
11. **Self-Organizing Teams:** The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
    
12. **Regular Reflection:** At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly.
