[[React]]

events are same as js
- on Click is camel cased
- and you need to put an event handler function inside the curly braces

### Passing parameters:
	use arrow function and place the parameter inside paranthesis
	onClick={() => function("prop value")}
	

## event object
It is an object containing **all the details about the click** that just happened. In React, this is technically called a **SyntheticEvent**. It is a wrapper around the browser's native event to ensure it works identically across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.

#### 2. The Code Pattern / Snippet
**Best for:** Syntax you need to memorize or reuse (e.g., "useEffect fetch data").
**The Science:** Uses **Chunking** (breaking complex code into small, usable blocks) and **Contextualization** (knowing *when* to use it, not just *how*).

**Copy this into a file named `T - Snippet`:**

## The Syntax
```jsx
// Minimal working example here. 
// Do not paste 50 lines of tutorial code.
// Isolate the specific logic.
