# CSV files
 - the first row gives the headers of the column
 ![[Pasted image 20251223105021.png]]

- import csv in python
- reader to iterate over the file
```python
import csv
with open("authors.csv","r") as file:

    reader = csv.reader(file)

    next(reader)

    for row in reader:

        print(row[1])
```
- dict reader will return a [[dictionary]] 

add a craft option
so instead of declaring a specific component
its a drag and drop element and the element mantains an interna ldatabse of relevant prompt elements and then keeps updating based on what users are finding useful so it will always use the one on the top
