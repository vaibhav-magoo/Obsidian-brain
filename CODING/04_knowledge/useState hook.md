 ROUGH NOTES
- hooks allow components to use react features
- makes a variable and a setter function 
- setter function will update its value in the [[Virtual DOM]] 
- hooks are used in function based component not [[class component]]
- you need to import React
- you can [[destructure]] it and only improt useState
- the useState function will return an array with two values, we [[destructure]] it and store it as a variable and setvariable
- we use setvariable function to update the values of our variable
